        [GTK][WPE] Build ANGLE with the EGL_NO_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_TYPES define
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=239039

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        Specify the EGL_NO_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_TYPES define when building ANGLE
        subproject for the GTK and WPE ports. This should avoid searching for
        platform-specific headers that might not be available at all during
        build, e.g. the X11 headers which are used by default on UNIX platforms.
